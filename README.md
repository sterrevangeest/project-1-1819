## Oba Muziek op Maat

This application helps a **_family care giver??_** who takes care of someone that suffers from dementia.

> As a way of helping care for and support people with dementia, music has been shown to often have a dramatic effect. Music can soothe, stimulate and bring to mind long-forgotten memories.

> Age UK. (2019, March 5). Music and Dementia from [Age Uk](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/health-wellbeing/conditions-illnesses/dementia/dementia-and-music/)

The family care giver can choose 30 songs that bring back these memories. These songs will be put on an iPod by employees of the OBA.
