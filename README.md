# oba Muziek op Maat

This application helps a **_family care giver??_** who takes care of someone that suffers from dementia.

> _"As a way of helping care for and support people with dementia, music has been shown to often have a dramatic effect. Music can soothe, stimulate and bring to mind long-forgotten memories."_ [Age Uk](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/health-wellbeing/conditions-illnesses/dementia/dementia-and-music/)
